Hi, I’m @anteok - my name is Vasilii Kuimov, I live in Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

Development is a significant part of my life, I enjoy writing code, learning about architectures, using Python everywhere. \
I have strong coding skills, understanding of Python, Linux. \
I've worked on different projects:
* scripting and automation in networking
* distributed realtime systems
* classic backends from scratch in different business areas, such as ad market, retail and financial market

I’m currently learning Rust, it looks amazing! \
I’m looking to collaborate on system engineering projects because of my love to Linux. \
I'm available at vasilykuimov@yandex.ru
